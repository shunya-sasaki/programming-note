# Git hooks

## What are Git hooks?

- Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commit, push, and receive.
- They allow you to automate tasks and enforce policies in your Git workflow.
- Here are some key points about Git hooks:
  - `pre-commit`: Runs before a commit is made. Useful for checking code style or running tests.
  - `commit-msg`: Runs after the commit message is entered. Can be used to validate the commit message format.
  - `pre-push`: Runs before a push operation. Can be used to run tests or checks before pushing code to a remote repository.

## Add hooks

Create `.githooks` directory in the project root.

```sh
mkdir .githooks
```

Run the following command to add `.githooks` directory to hooksPath.

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

:::note
The configuration for `hooksPath` is not stored in the Git repository.
Each project member needs to run the configuration command individually.
:::

Create a hook file in the `.githooks` directory. For example, to create a pre-commit hook, add a file `.githooks/pre-commit`.

You can write hook files using Bash, Ruby, or Python. Below is an example of a pre-push hook written in Bash.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# pre-push
echo "Running pre-push hook"

while read local_ref local_sha remote_ref remote_sha; do
    branch_name=$(echo "$local_ref" | sed 's/refs\/heads\///')
done

if [ "$branch_name" = "main" ]; then
    echo "Pushing to main branch with normal push is not allowed!" >&2
    echo "Please use the command \`npm run release\` to push changes!!" >&2
    exit 1
elif [ "$branch_name" = "" ]; then
    echo "No changes pushed"
else
    echo "branch_name is not main"
fi
exit 0
```

If you use python, add `#!/usr/bin env python3` or `#!/ust/bin/env python` to the hook file as the following.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# pre-push
print("Running pre-push hook")
```
